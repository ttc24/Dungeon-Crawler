Gameplay Guide
==============

Use the numbered menu to explore rooms, fight monsters, visit shops, and descend deeper into the dungeon.

At any time choose **8. Show Map** to display the dungeon grid. The map marks your location with ``@``, visited rooms with ``.``, and unexplored or blocked rooms with ``#``.

Progress is automatically saved whenever you clear a floor.

Boss Encounters
---------------
Each floor culminates in a boss battle. Every boss showcases a distinctive
mechanic—such as a channelled nuke that must be interrupted, a summoner that
spawns adds, or a teleporting assassin—to keep encounters fresh. Defeating a
boss always grants a guaranteed reward like rare loot, a permanent stat boost,
or a choice of upgrades.

Special Events
--------------
To break up the routine of combat, each floor also features one signature event:

* **Shrine Gauntlet** – fight successive waves to earn blessings.
* **Puzzle Chamber** – solve puzzles or riddles for unique gear.
* **Escort Mission** – protect an NPC for a substantial reward.

These events introduce variety and appear once per floor.

Enemy Intents
-------------
Foes now telegraph their behaviour each round.  Every enemy rolls one of
three intents—Aggressive, Defensive or Unpredictable—weighted by its
archetype.  The selected intent is announced before the action resolves,
for example::

    Goblin steadies a heavy strike…
    Beetle curls into its shell.

Pay attention to these tells to decide when to Defend or attempt a Feint.
