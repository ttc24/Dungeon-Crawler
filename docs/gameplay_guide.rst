Gameplay Guide
==============

Use the numbered menu to explore rooms, fight monsters, visit shops, and descend deeper into the dungeon.

At any time choose **8. Show Map** to display the dungeon grid. The map marks your location with ``@``, visited rooms with ``.``, and unexplored or blocked rooms with ``#``.

Progress is automatically saved whenever you clear a floor.
