Gameplay Guide
==============

Use the numbered menu to explore rooms, fight monsters, visit shops, and descend deeper into the dungeon.

At any time choose **8. Show Map** to display the dungeon grid. The map marks your location with ``@``, visited rooms with ``.``, and unexplored or blocked rooms with ``#``.

Progress is automatically saved whenever you clear a floor.

Classes, Guilds and Races
-------------------------
Characters grow through three axes of customization.  A **class** supplies a
stat block and unique abilities that consume stamina.  For instance, the
Barbarian begins with 130 health, 12 attack power and can unleash *Rage*
``(30)`` or a sweeping *Whirlwind* ``(40)``.  Druids wield nature magic through
*Wild Shape* ``(35)`` and *Entangle* ``(20)`` while maintaining balanced stats.

Joining a **guild** applies permanent perks.  The **Shadow Brotherhood** grants
+4 attack power and reduces all skill costs by 5 stamina, turning members into
efficient assassins.  Other guilds focus on raw power, magical prowess or
supportive talents.

Selecting a **race** provides innate bonuses.  Tieflings gain +2 attack power
and the *Infernal resistance* trait, whereas Dragonborn receive +2 health,
+2 attack power and the *Draconic breath* trait.

Boss Encounters
---------------
Each floor culminates in a boss battle against a foe unique to that level.
Bosses telegraph their intentions so observant players can react to heavy
attacks or defensive postures. Defeating a boss now awards the entire loot
table associated with that encounter, guaranteeing meaningful rewards.

Special Events
--------------
To break up the routine of combat, each floor draws exactly one signature event
from a curated pool:

* **Shrine Gauntlet** – fight successive waves to earn blessings.
* **Puzzle Chamber** – solve puzzles or riddles for unique gear.
* **Escort Mission** – protect an NPC for a substantial reward.

These events introduce variety and appear once per floor.

Enemy Intents
-------------
Foes now telegraph their behaviour each round.  Every enemy rolls one of
three intents—Aggressive, Defensive or Unpredictable—weighted by its
archetype.  The selected intent is announced before the action resolves,
for example::

    Goblin steadies a heavy strike…
    Beetle curls into its shell.

Pay attention to these tells to decide when to Defend or attempt a Feint.

Aggressive telegraphs often precede a heavy attack that deals roughly
50% more damage.  Unpredictable intents may unleash wild attacks which
suffer a 20% accuracy penalty but have a small chance to inflict double
damage.
