Gameplay Guide
==============

Use the numbered menu to explore rooms, fight monsters, visit shops, and descend deeper into the dungeon.

At any time choose **8. Show Map** to display the dungeon grid. The map marks your location with ``@``, visited rooms with ``.``, and unexplored or blocked rooms with ``#``.

Progress is automatically saved whenever you clear a floor.

Random Events
-------------
As you explore, floors can trigger random events:

* **MerchantEvent** – a travelling merchant appears and opens the shop.
* **PuzzleEvent** – solve a riddle for a chance to earn extra gold.
* **TrapEvent** – an unexpected hazard deals damage to the player.

These events add variety and can occur on any floor.
