# Dungeon Crawler

Dungeon Crawler is a small text-based adventure inspired by the outrageous humor of the *Dungeon Crawler Carl* novels. Guide your hero through procedurally generated floors packed with quirky monsters, wild loot, and snarky NPCs.

## Installation

The game only requires Python 3. Run it directly using the provided script:

```bash
python3 dungeon_crawler.py
```

Make sure the file is executable if you wish to launch it with `./dungeon_crawler.py`.

## Running the Game

You will be prompted for a character name. Use the number menu to explore rooms, fight monsters, visit shops, and descend deeper into the dungeon.

Progress is automatically saved whenever you clear a floor. On the next launch you will be asked if you want to continue.

## Objectives

- Survive each floor and defeat the boss to descend.
- Collect ridiculous weapons and helpful companions.
- Rack up the highest score on the in-game leaderboard.

## Inspirations

The style borrows heavily from Matt Dinniman's *Dungeon Crawler Carl* series. Expect sarcastic narration, strange NPCs, and outlandish equipment (yes, even an "Exploding Rubber Ducky of Doom").
