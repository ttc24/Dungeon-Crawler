# Dungeon Crawler

Dungeon Crawler is a small text-based adventure that borrows the core ideas of the *Dungeon Crawler Carl* novels while toning down the humor. Guide your hero through procedurally generated floors filled with monsters, treasure, and meaningful character choices.

## Installation

The game only requires Python 3. Run it directly using the main module:

```bash
python3 -m dungeoncrawler
```

Make sure the file is executable if you wish to launch it with `./dungeon_crawler.py`.

## Running the Game

You will be prompted for a character name. Use the number menu to explore rooms, fight monsters, visit shops, and descend deeper into the dungeon.

At any time you may choose **8. Show Map** to display a grid of the dungeon. The map marks your location with `@`, rooms you've visited with `.`, and unexplored or blocked rooms with `#`.

Progress is automatically saved whenever you clear a floor. On the next launch you will be asked if you want to continue.

## Objectives

- Survive each floor and defeat the boss to descend.
- Collect powerful weapons and trustworthy companions.
- Rack up the highest score on the in-game leaderboard.

## Features

- Unlock new playable races when reaching the third floor.
- Choose from additional classes like Cleric, Paladin and Bard.
- Special floor events add variety as you progress deeper.
- Floors grow in size and feature unique enemy and boss sets.
- Battle through 18 floors of escalating challenge.
